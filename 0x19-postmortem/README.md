# Postmortem Report

## Incident Report for Database Connection Failure

### Summary

On March 8th, 2024, at 10:30 AM UTC, a database connection failure occurred, causing disruption to the services reliant on the database. The affected system was running on a MongoDB database with Node.js backend.

### Timeline

- **10:30 AM UTC:** Users reported inability to access the application, with error messages indicating a database connection issue.
- **10:35 AM UTC:** Initial investigation began, confirming that both the server and database services were running.
- **10:40 AM UTC:** Manual checks on database connections from the server confirmed a failure to establish connection.
- **10:45 AM UTC:** Review of server logs showed no explicit errors related to the database connection.
- **10:50 AM UTC:** Examination of database logs revealed a sudden spike in connection attempts followed by abrupt terminations.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Further inspection revealed that the database server was overwhelmed with connection requests, leading to its automatic termination of connections.
- **11:05 AM UTC:** Adjustments made to the database connection pool settings to handle increased traffic.
- **11:10 AM UTC:** Database server restarted to apply changes.
- **11:15 AM UTC:** Monitoring tools implemented to track connection spikes and prevent future overloads.

### Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the incident was identified as a sudden surge in connection attempts to the database server, overwhelming its capacity and leading to automatic termination of connections. This surge was likely due to an unexpected increase in user activity.
To resolve the issue, adjustments were made to the database connection pool settings to better handle high traffic situations. Additionally, monitoring tools were implemented to provide real-time insights into connection patterns and prevent similar incidents in the future.

### Corrective and Preventive Measures

- Regular monitoring of system metrics to identify and address performance bottlenecks proactively.
- Implementing automatic scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
- Conducting load testing on the system to simulate high traffic scenarios and ensure adequate capacity.
- Regular review and optimization of database query performance to minimize resource usage.
